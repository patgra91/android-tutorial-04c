Lesson 2: Activities and intents

2.1: Activities and intents

2.2: Activity lifecycle and state

5. Coding challenge

Challenge: Create a simple shopping-list app with a main activity for the list the user is building, and a second activity for a list of common shopping items.

The main activity should contain the list to build, which should be made up of ten empty TextView elements.
An Add Item button on the main activity launches a second activity that contains a list of common shopping items (Cheese, Rice, Apples, and so on). Use Button elements to display the items.
Choosing an item returns the user to the main activity, and updates an empty TextView to include the chosen item.
Use an Intent to pass information from one Activity to another. Make sure that the current state of the shopping list is saved when the user rotates the device.


2.3: Implicit intents

8. Coding challenge

Challenge: In a previous practical challenge you created a shopping list app builder with an Activity to display the list, and another Activity to pick an item. Add an EditText and a Button to the shopping list Activity to locate a particular store on a map.
